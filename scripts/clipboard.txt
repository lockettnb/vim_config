+ Arch vim in compiled without clipboard support, this is why I have been
  using xsel to copy/paste to the X clipboard.  Also with the mouse enabled
  the Primary selection does not work.

+ vim Primary/Clipboard registers are missing when there is no +clipboard
option compiled into the program
    PRIMARY ("*)
    CLIPBOARD ("+)

+ my current fancy clipboard copies text to new buffer then writes the buffer
  to xsel .... however this messes up with split screen or when  help is open
    |function! ClipIt()
    |    :enew
    |    :normal P
    |    :silent %w ! xsel -ib
    |    :bd!
    |endfunction

+ new approch is to use shellescape() to handel all the complcated quoting 
  stuff
