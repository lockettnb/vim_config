Super_L is an X keysym. Tmux runs in a terminal. It is up to your terminal
emulator to transform a keysym into a character sequence. So you would have to
configure both your terminal emulator and tmux.

Looking at the tmux documentation, the prefix can only been a known key name
with an optional modifier. So you can set the tmux prefix to a key combination
you don't use, say M-F12, and get your terminal to send the character sequence
for M-F12 when you press Super_L. With a little more work, you could use a key
that your keyboard probably doesn't have (tmux accepts F13 through F20 as key
names, but they have to be declared in terminfo).

On the terminal emulator side, you would have to arrange for Super_L to
generate the key sequence \e\e[24~ (for M-F12) or \e[34~ (for F20) (where \e is
the escape character). How to do this depends on the terminal emulator (and
some aren't configurable enough to do it). With xterm, it's done through X
resources:

! Make Super_L act as Meta+F12
XTerm.VT100.translations:       #override \
    <Key>Super_L:  string("\033\033[24~")

You may hit a snag that Super_L is normally a modifier, and modifier keys don't
always work when a non-modifier is required. If you don't want Super_L to be a
modifier, you can take its modifier away, or (less confusingly) use a different
keysym for the physical key. This can be done through xmodmap (old-fashioned
and simple to understand), through xkb (the modern, poorly-documented, powerful
and complex way), or perhaps through your desktop environment's GUI
configuration tool.


------------------------------------------------------------------
setxkbmap -option "ctrl:nocaps"
setxkbmap -option "caps:swapescape"



------------------------------------------------------------------
modmap -e "keycode 9 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock"   #this will make Esc to act as Caps Lock
xmodmap -e "keycode 66 = Escape NoSymbol Escape"        #this will make Caps Lock to act as Esc



------------------------------------------------------------------
xmodmap -e "remove Lock = Caps_Lock"
xmodmap -e "keycode 9 = Caps_Lock NoSymbol Caps_Lock"
xmodmap -e "keycode 66 = Escape NoSymbol Escape"
xmodmap -pke > ~/.xmodmap
Doesn't work in Linux Mint 17.1 (which is based on Ubuntu) :( – Janek Warchoł Nov 20 '15 at 21:02
Had to change "remove Lock = Caps_Lock" to "clear Lock" for it to work – sofia Dec 23 '15 at 12:35

I'm late to answer, but the usual way to swap Esc and Ctrl is with the following lines in the ~/.Xmodmap file:

clear Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
add Lock = Caps_Lock

------------------------------------------------------------------
! Swap caps lock and escape
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Escape
add Lock = Caps_Lock

and call it ".speedswapper". Then open a terminal and type

$ xmodmap ~/.speedswapper
